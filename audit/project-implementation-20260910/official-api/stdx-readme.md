# Cangjie stdx

## Introduction

The extension library `stdx` is an extension module provided by the Cangjie programming language (i.e., a non-core standard library, but an official supplementary feature set). It is a key component of the language ecosystem, supplementing Cangjie with more practical capabilities covering multiple domains, including aspect-oriented programming, compression and decompression, security (secure encryption capabilities/message digest algorithms/Asymmetric encryption and decryption and signature algorithms/digital certificate processing functions), encoding and decoding (base64/hex/json/url), networking (http/tls), logging, syntax parsing, unit test extensions, concurrent programming model, non-local control operation and serialization.

## Operating Instructions

For APIs related to stdx, please refer to [API Interface Description](./doc/summary_cjnative_EN.md).
For relevant guidance, please refer to [Development Guide](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_docs/).

## Quick Start

This repository provides convenient scripts to quickly download and extract binary artifacts for a specific version.

### Linux/macOS

This requires `curl` and `unzip`. Please ensure these tools are installed in your environment.

Execute directly in your command line (note the arguments at the end, modify as needed):

```shell
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx/raw/main/downloader.sh)" -- 1.0.0.1
```

### Windows

Before running the script, you may need to adjust the PowerShell execution policy (only needs to be done once).

Please open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then, run the script in a regular PowerShell window (note the arguments at the end, modify as needed):

```powershell
irm https://raw.gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx/raw/main/downloader.ps1 -OutFile "$env:TEMP\downloader.ps1"; & "$env:TEMP\downloader.ps1" 1.0.0.1
```

### Parameters

- `<version>`: **Required**. Specifies the version to download, e.g., `1.0.0.1`.
- `-p <platform-arch>`: **Optional**. Specifies the platform and architecture. If omitted, the script will auto-detect the current system.
- `-d <extract-dir>`: **Optional**. Specifies the target path for extraction. If omitted, it defaults to the current directory.

**Usage Examples:**

```shell
# On Linux/macOS, download the ohos-aarch64 version of v1.0.0.1 and extract it to the ./cangjie_libs directory
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx/raw/main/downloader.sh)" -- 1.0.0.1 -p ohos-aarch64 -d ./cangjie_libs
```

```powershell
# On Windows, download the windows-x64 version of v1.0.0.1 and extract it to the C:\cangjie_libs directory
irm https://raw.gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx/raw/main/downloader.ps1 -OutFile "$env:TEMP\downloader.ps1"; & "$env:TEMP\downloader.ps1" 1.0.0.1 -p windows-x64 -d C:\cangjie_libs
```

## Constraints

Support for building `stdx` in Ubuntu/macOS (x86_64, aarch64), Cangjie SDK 1.0.0 and above versions, please refer to the [Build Dependency Tools](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_build/blob/main/doc_en/env.md).

Note: Future versions of this extension library may contain incompatible changes, and cross-version backward compatibility is not guaranteed. Please fully assess the version adaptation risks before use.

## Compilation and Building

### Build Steps

#### Configure Cangjie SDK

Configure the Cangjie SDK environment:

```shell
source <cangjie sdk path>
```

Execute the following command to verify whether the installation is successful:

```shell
cjc -v
```

#### Prepare source code

Download the source code

```bash
git clone https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx.git
```

#### Build Command

##### Method 1

Enter the project directory, and run the following commands:

```shell
python3 build.py clean
python3 build.py build -t release --target-lib=<absolute path of openssl lib>
python3 build.py install
```

1. `build.py clean` command is used to clear temporary files in the workspace.
2. `build.py build` command starts the compilation：

    - `-t` or `--build-type`，specifies the type of build artifact, which can be either `release` or `debug`
    - `--target-lib` specifies the openssl lib directory

3. `build.py install` command installs the build artifacts to the `target` directory.

If the compilation is successful, a product directory named target by default will be obtained in the project directory.

For more information, please take a look at the [build.py](build.py) or use `--help`

##### Method 2

Currently, stdx (main branch) also supports building via cjpm, and the build command is as follows:

```shell
cjpm build
```

For detailed usage of cjpm, refer to [cjpm Documentation](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_docs/blob/main/docs/tools/source_en/cmd-tools/cjpm_manual.md)

Building via cjpm has some dependencies, see [dependency list](./doc/libs_stdx_en/source_code_dependency.md#Dependencies).

Currently, the stdx binary packages built via cjpm do not include aspect_cj and syntax, and there are no fuzz packages on the Windows platform.

### Integration Build Guide

For integration building, please refer to the [Cangjie SDK Integration Build Guide](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_build/blob/main/README_zh.md).

## Instructions for use

### Import stdx

`stdx` provides two types of binaries: static and dynamic. Both are used independently and developers can reference them according to actual conditions.

Add the following configuration to the `cjpm.toml` file of the code project:

```toml
[target.x86_64-w64-mingw32]                                                     # System architecture and OS information
  [target.x86_64-w64-mingw32.bin-dependencies]
    path-option = ["D:\\cangjiestdx\\windows_x86_64_cjnative\\stdx\\dynamic\\stdx"] # The stdx path is configured according to the actual situation
```

explain:

- x86_64-w64-mingw32：This configuration item indicates the operating system architecture information of the machine where the code is compiled. This information can be obtained by executing `cjc -v`. Developers should configure according to the actual situation. For example, the output of executing `cjc -v` is as follows, and the configuration is `x86_64-w64-mingw32`.

  ```text
  Cangjie Compiler: 0.59.4 (cjnative)
  Target: x86_64-w64-mingw32
  ```

- x86_64-w64-mingw32.bin-dependencies：Please replace x86_64-w64-mingw32 in the configuration with the actual operating system information.
- path-option：`stdx` The path where the binary is located.

> **illustrate:**
>
> - `cjpm.toml` is the configuration file of the Cangjie package management tool CJPM. For details, please refer to the Cangjie Programming Language Tool User Guide.
> - The configuration method is the same for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
> - On macOS, using stdx may trigger a popup warning about unknown source or inability to detect malware. After extracting stdx, you can run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine <stdx extraction path> &> /dev/null || true` in the terminal to remove the quarantine attribute. For example: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/darwin_x86_64_cjnative/ &> /dev/null || true`
> - If you import the static library of `stdx` and use the crypto and net packages, you need to add `-lcrypt32` to `compile-option` on `Windows`.
> - When using dynamic `stdx` binaries (`.so`/`.dll`), OpenSSL is resolved at runtime via `dlopen/dlsym` (Unix-like) or `LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress` (Windows); linking OpenSSL statically (`.a`/`.lib`) into the application will not be used by this runtime resolver.
> - On `Linux`, the default static `stdx` libraries use an OpenSSL resolver in `auto` mode: they prefer directly linked OpenSSL symbols, and fall back to `dlopen/dlsym` only when needed. If the fallback may be used, add `-ldl`.
> - When linking OpenSSL statically for the default `auto` static libraries, `--whole-archive` is only needed if you want to force `libssl.a` and `libcrypto.a` into the final executable; otherwise the fallback path may still try to load system `libssl/libcrypto`.
> - For `static-static-link-extern/stdx`, do not use `--whole-archive` or `-force_load` as the default. Place the OpenSSL archive inputs (`libssl.a` and `libcrypto.a`) after `stdx` libraries that reference them so the linker pulls only the required objects.
> - In cross-compilation scenarios, if there is a need to develop custom macro packages and their business logic must rely on stdx for implementation, the stdx path for the local development platform must also be configured in addition to that for the target runtime platform.

**Default `static/stdx` auto resolver example**: after configuring the `stdx` static library path through `cjpm.toml` or your existing build command, set `STATIC_OPENSSL_DIR` to the directory that stores OpenSSL static libraries. The following command shows only the OpenSSL archive link options and forces the OpenSSL archives into the final executable.

```bash
export STATIC_OPENSSL_DIR=/path/to/openssl/lib

# GNU ld
cjc main.cj \
    --link-option "-Bstatic" \
    --link-option "--whole-archive" \
    --link-option "${STATIC_OPENSSL_DIR}/libssl.a" \
    --link-option "${STATIC_OPENSSL_DIR}/libcrypto.a" \
    --link-option "--no-whole-archive" \
    --link-option "-Bdynamic"

# Apple ld64
cjc main.cj \
    --link-option "-force_load" \
    --link-option "${STATIC_OPENSSL_DIR}/libssl.a" \
    --link-option "-force_load" \
    --link-option "${STATIC_OPENSSL_DIR}/libcrypto.a"
```

For `static-static-link-extern/stdx`, after configuring the `stdx` static library path through `cjpm.toml` or your existing build command, provide the OpenSSL archives normally. The following command shows only the OpenSSL archive link options:

```bash
export STATIC_OPENSSL_DIR=/path/to/openssl/lib

cjc main.cj \
    --link-option "${STATIC_OPENSSL_DIR}/libssl.a" \
    --link-option "${STATIC_OPENSSL_DIR}/libcrypto.a"
```

### Installed Binary Layout

The following uses the installed `stdx` on Linux/cjnative as an example to illustrate its binary layout.

- `dynamic/stdx`: dynamic libraries and related runtime artifacts
- `static/stdx`: default static libraries and FFI archives
- `static-static-link-extern/stdx`: static libraries exposed for external static linking

The installed package should be documented against these output directories instead of intermediate files under `build_temp`.

### OpenSSL Static Linking Layout

For Linux/cjnative, the installed static package layout distinguishes two OpenSSL-linking behaviors by directory:

- `static/stdx`: the default static-library directory
- `static-static-link-extern/stdx`: the directory for external static linking

Key differences:

- Libraries from `static/stdx` may fall back to runtime OpenSSL loading when necessary.
- Libraries from `static-static-link-extern/stdx` do not use `dlopen/dlsym` fallback and do not depend on system OpenSSL discovery at runtime.
- When using `static-static-link-extern/stdx`, the final application link step must provide the required `libssl.a` and `libcrypto.a`.
- If the linked OpenSSL archive is missing required symbols, the build fails at final link time instead of falling back at runtime.

Version reminder:

- `stdx` expects an OpenSSL 3.x dependency set. If the OpenSSL version is too low, required symbols may be missing and the build or runtime may fail.
- Do not mix different OpenSSL major versions across compile, link, and runtime stages. For example, compiling against OpenSSL 3 headers but linking or loading OpenSSL 1.1 can lead to missing symbols, ABI mismatch, or undefined behavior.
- When using `static-static-link-extern/stdx`, make sure `libssl.a` and `libcrypto.a` come from the same OpenSSL build and version.
- When using `dynamic/stdx` or libraries from `static/stdx`, make sure the runtime-loaded `libssl` and `libcrypto` files are from the same OpenSSL version family.

Suggested handling:

- If the OpenSSL version is too low, upgrade to a complete OpenSSL 3.x release first, then rebuild or relink the application.
- If compile-time headers, link-time archives, and runtime dynamic libraries are not from the same version family, replace them with artifacts from one consistent OpenSSL installation.
- If you use `static-static-link-extern/stdx`, clean the old link inputs and relink with one matching pair of `libssl.a` and `libcrypto.a`.
- When using `static-static-link-extern/stdx`, the final link step must provide the OpenSSL symbols required by the `stdx` static libraries that participate in linking.
- If you use a trimmed OpenSSL archive with `static-static-link-extern/stdx` and the final link reports missing OpenSSL symbols, it means the current `stdx` link set still requires those symbols. Add back the corresponding real implementations in `libssl.a` or `libcrypto.a`.
- Do not decide trimming only from the application's direct OpenSSL usage. Also check whether the linked `stdx` static libraries still reference additional OpenSSL symbols.
- Do not use hand-written empty implementations to bypass these link errors. An empty implementation may satisfy the linker, but it does not provide correct runtime behavior and may cause leaks, state corruption, functional errors, or security problems.
- If you use `dynamic/stdx` or `static/stdx`, remove conflicting old `libssl` and `libcrypto` files from the runtime search path and keep only the intended OpenSSL 3.x library set visible to the loader.
- If you encounter missing-symbol errors, first verify the exact library files that are being linked or loaded, then check whether they all come from the same OpenSSL version and architecture.

Typical OpenSSL-related libraries affected by this distinction include:

- `libstdx.crypto.digest.a`
- `libstdx.crypto.keys.a`
- `libstdx.crypto.crypto.a`
- `libstdx.crypto.x509.a`
- `libstdx.net.tls.a`

Use `static-static-link-extern/stdx` when you want an explicit static-link contract with OpenSSL and do not want runtime fallback behavior. In this mode, OpenSSL archive location is controlled by the application's existing link flags such as `-L` and `link-option`.

**Configuration example**：Assuming the development environment is Windows x86_64 and importing the dynamic binary of `stdx`, the `cjpm.toml` configuration example is as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]

[package]
  cjc-version = "0.59.4"
  compile-option = ""
  description = "nothing here"
  link-option = ""
  name = "test"
  output-type = "executable"
  override-compile-option = ""
  src-dir = ""
  target-dir = ""
  version = "1.0.0"
  package-configuration = {}

[target.x86_64-w64-mingw32]                                                     # System architecture and OS information
  [target.x86_64-w64-mingw32.bin-dependencies]
    path-option = ["D:\\cangjiestdx\\windows_x86_64_cjnative\\stdx\\dynamic\\stdx"] # The stdx path is configured according to the actual situation
```

### Using stdx

In the Cangjie source code file that needs to use `stdx`, import the corresponding package provided by `stdx` through import, and then call the API provided by the package. The import format is:

**import stdx.fullPackageName.itemName**

`fullPackageName` is the package name given in [package list](./doc/libs_stdx_en/libs_overview.md#package-list), `itemName` is the name of a visible declaration or definition,  `*` means importing all visible top-level declarations or definitions, for example:

- import stdx.net.http.ServerBuilder：Import the top-level declaration of ServerBuilder in the net.http package of the stdx module.
- import stdx.net.http.\* ：Import the net.http package of the stdx module.
- import stdx.log.\* ：Import the log package from the stdx module.

### Usage Examples

Assuming that the developer is developing on Linux and wants to import the static binary of `stdx`, the `cjpm.toml` configuration reference is as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]

[package]
  cjc-version = "0.59.4"
  compile-option = "-ldl"
  description = "nothing here"
  link-option = ""
  name = "test"
  output-type = "executable"
  src-dir = ""
  target-dir = ""
  version = "1.0.0"
  package-configuration = {}

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
  [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.bin-dependencies]
    path-option = ["/target/linux_x86_64_cjnative/static/stdx"]  # stdx path is configured according to actual situation
```

Write code: Create an `HTTP` service using the `net.http` package.

```cangjie
package test

import stdx.net.http.ServerBuilder

main () {
    // 1. Build a Server instance
    let server = ServerBuilder()
                        .addr("127.0.0.1")
                        .port(8080)
                        .build()
    // 2. Register HttpRequestHandler
    server.distributor.register("/index", {httpContext =>
        httpContext.responseBuilder.body("Hello 仓颉!")
    })
    // 3. Start the service
    server.serve()
}
```
